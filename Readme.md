-> Yatraa

An Indian Heritage Exploration and Trip Planning App

⸻

-> What is Yatraa?

Yatraa is an iOS application built using Swift and SwiftUI that allows users to explore UNESCO-listed heritage sites of India and plan realistic trips to them.

The app combines curated heritage information with structured trip planning. Users can:
    - Browse cultural, natural, and mixed heritage sites
    - View historical context and UNESCO recognition details
    - Generate a day-wise itinerary
    - Get an estimated trip cost based on group size and travel style

The application works fully offline and does not depend on external travel APIs.

-> Why This App Was Built

India has one of the richest cultural and historical legacies in the world, yet many heritage sites are:
    - Poorly understood
    - Underexplored
    - Treated as casual tourist spots rather than cultural spaces

Yatraa was created to promote intentional travel.

Instead of being just another travel app, it encourages users to:
    - Understand the historical importance of a site
    - Plan visits realistically
    - Budget properly before travelling
    - Approach heritage with structure and respect

The idea is to make heritage exploration thoughtful rather than impulsive.

⸻

-> Target Users

Yatraa is primarily designed for:
    - College students
    - Budget-conscious travellers
    - Small friend groups planning short trips
    - Young professionals interested in cultural exploration

The app assumes users want:
    - Clear cost estimates
    - Structured schedules
    - Practical travel timelines
    - Educational value alongside travel planning

It is especially suited for users who want clarity before committing to a trip.

⸻

-> Core Idea

Yatraa connects cultural awareness with practical planning.

By combining historical information, realistic travel modelling, and cost estimation, it transforms heritage visits into structured experiences rather than unplanned outings.

The focus is not on booking or commercialization, but on awareness, structure, and meaningful exploration.
